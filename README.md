# Timed-Math-Challenge
 Generate a random number of questions between 1 and 20 as quickly as possible. 
 While there are no penalties or anything like that, have fun trying to challenge yourself to see how well you perform. Increase the range of the operands to make the game more challenging. You can also change the range for the number of qestions to generate more questions.
